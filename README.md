# yet another tool in the battle for the internet.

this is currently being built still. I need to add more news outlets, so it is not in the chrome extension store, but if you would like to use it you can at your own free will. all you must do is:
1. clone this repo.
2. open `chrome://extensions`
3. turn on developer mode
4. click `load unpacked` on the left side of the screen.
5. point it to this folder on your machine.
